Database Architecture: DAO Pattern, JDBC, DataSource & HikariCP Explained

This document provides a complete, interview-ready explanation of how Java applications connect to databases using DAO Pattern, JDBC, DataSource, and HikariCP.
It is written for backend engineers preparing for interviews and studying Spring Boot internals.

1. DAO Pattern (Data Access Object)
What is DAO?

The Data Access Object (DAO) pattern is a structural design pattern used to separate database logic from business logic.

Instead of writing SQL queries inside Controllers or Services, we create DAO classes that handle all database operations.

Purpose

Encapsulate database access

Hide SQL implementation from the rest of the application

Improve modularity, testability, and maintainability

Make switching databases easier (MySQL → Oracle → PostgreSQL)

Example
public interface UserDao {
    User findById(int id);
    void save(User user);
}

public class UserDaoImpl implements UserDao {
    @Override
    public User findById(int id) {
        // SQL query + JDBC code
    }

    @Override
    public void save(User user) {
        // SQL insert logic
    }
}

Why interviews ask DAO questions?

Because DAO shows you understand:

layering

abstraction

database clean architecture

SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)

2. JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
What JDBC Actually Does

JDBC is the core low-level technology that Java uses to talk to relational databases.

JDBC provides classes like:

DriverManager

Connection

Statement

PreparedStatement

ResultSet

Behind the scenes:

The JDBC driver registers itself with DriverManager

Java calls DriverManager.getConnection()

Driver returns a DB-specific Connection implementation

SQL is executed through the connection

Raw JDBC Example
Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password);
PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM users");
ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery();


This is the foundation on which Spring Boot builds everything.

3. DataSource (The Factory for Connections)
What is a DataSource?

A DataSource is the modern replacement for DriverManager.

It is a factory that creates database connections.

Instead of manually calling:

DriverManager.getConnection()


We configure a DataSource, and Spring Boot does:

DataSource.getConnection()

Why DataSource exists?

Because manually opening connections for every request is slow.
Creating a DB connection involves:

TCP socket creation

authentication

SSL negotiation

handshake

resource allocation

This is expensive.

DataSource enables connection pooling, which increases performance dramatically.

4. What is a Connection Pool?
Problem Without a Pool

Every request → new DB connection → slow → server overload → DB crash.

Solution

A connection pool:

Creates a fixed number of DB connections at startup

Stores them in memory

Reuses them for multiple requests

Avoids repeated connection creation

Improves performance by 100x

Prevents DB overload

Ensures stability under high traffic

How a Connection Pool Works (Simple Explanation)

Application starts

Pool creates (for example) 5 connections

Request arrives → thread borrows a connection

Query executes (2–50 ms)

Connection returned to pool

Next request reuses the same connection

A single connection can serve hundreds of requests per second.

Important Terms
Setting	Meaning
minimumIdle	Minimum connections pool keeps alive
maximumPoolSize	Maximum simultaneous DB connections allowed
idleTimeout	Time after which unused connections are removed
maxLifetime	Maximum lifespan for a connection
5. HikariCP (The Fastest Connection Pool)
What is HikariCP?

HikariCP is the default connection pool used in Spring Boot.

It is known for:

very low latency

high throughput

minimal garbage creation

industry-leading performance

Netflix, Airbnb, and many enterprises use HikariCP.

Why Spring Boot chooses Hikari?

Because it’s:

the fastest

the most efficient

the least memory-hungry

extremely stable under heavy load

Default Spring Boot Hikari Settings
Property	Default
maximumPoolSize	10
minimumIdle	10
connectionTimeout	30 seconds
idleTimeout	10 minutes
maxLifetime	30 minutes
6. How Spring Boot Uses JDBC + DataSource + Hikari Internally

Each layer hides the complexity of the layer below.

You only see:

userRepository.findAll();


But behind that, a full chain executes.

7. Why Pool Size Does NOT Equal Number of Users

A massive misconception is:

“Pool size 10 means only 10 users can access the database”

This is incorrect.

Pool size determines simultaneous DB operations, NOT number of users.

Example:
If each DB query takes 10ms:

1 connection = 100 queries/sec
10 connections = 1000 queries/sec

With 100 app servers:

1000 queries/sec × 100 servers = 100,000 DB queries/sec


This is how companies scale to millions of users.

8. Summary Table
Concept	Explanation
DAO	Encapsulates DB logic
JDBC	Core Java DB technology
DriverManager	Old way of creating connections
DataSource	Modern way; supports pooling
Connection Pool	Reuses connections for performance
HikariCP	Fastest connection pool used by Spring Boot
Pool Size	Max parallel DB queries, not users
9. Final High-Level Understanding
DAO

Handles data logic.

JDBC

Executes SQL.

DataSource

Creates and manages DB connections.

HikariCP

Optimizes and pools connections for speed.

Spring Boot

Uses all of these together invisibly to provide high performance and reliable database access.
